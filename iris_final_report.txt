
# Final Report: Iris Species Classification

## 1. Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build machine learning models that can accurately classify the species of iris flowers based on their morphological features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The models will be trained and evaluated to identify the most accurate and reliable algorithm for this classification task.

## 2. Dataset Description
The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers with the following columns:
- `sepal_length` (cm)
- `sepal_width` (cm)
- `petal_length` (cm)
- `petal_width` (cm)
- `species`: one of three classes - Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

After removing outliers using the IQR method, 131 clean samples remained for model training.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- The dataset is balanced with 50 samples for each class originally.
- `petal_length` and `petal_width` show the strongest separation between species.
- A strong correlation (0.96) was observed between petal length and petal width.
- No missing values were present.
- One duplicate row was removed.
- Minor outliers in sepal width were detected and handled.

## 4. Feature Engineering
- Outliers were removed using the IQR method for each numerical column.
- Categorical target (`species`) was label encoded.
- Numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler to improve model performance.

## 5. Model Building
Three machine learning models were trained and evaluated:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

Train-test split was performed using an 80-20 ratio.

## 6. Results Comparison

| Model                  | Accuracy |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression   | 94.44%   |
| Random Forest         | 96.30%   |
| Support Vector Machine| 96.30%   |

- Random Forest and SVM outperformed Logistic Regression by a small margin.
- All models showed strong performance, particularly in distinguishing Setosa.
- Versicolor and Virginica had minor misclassifications.

## 7. Conclusion
All three models achieved high accuracy, with Random Forest and SVM being the best performers at 96.3%. Given its balance between performance and interpretability, **Random Forest** is recommended for deployment.
